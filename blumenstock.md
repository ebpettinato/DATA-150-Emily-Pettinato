# Blumenstock's Humbler Data Science Response

    In his article “Don’t Forget People in the Use of Big Data for Development”, Josh Blumenstock expands on the potential advantages and disadvantages of implementing big data in the developing world and how to move forward. He begins with the promising opportunities that big data provides. Using algorithms intended for social media, researchers have been able to determine much more about a population than who is friends with who. With the ownership of a mobile phone, people who previously would be unable to access financial services can now receive a credit score. Through advertisement software that detect “digital signatures of poverty” humanitarians can better match resources to those who need it and researchers have been able to develop various data trend maps much more efficiently.
