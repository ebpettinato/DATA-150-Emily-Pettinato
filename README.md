Hi! Welcome to my repository! My name is Emily Pettinato. I am a freshman at William & Mary and  I am loving being a member of the tribe. I enjoy being busy, and look foward to finding clubs and orgnizations to join this semester. In highschool I was the President of Model United Nations, the Secretary of the Nonprofit Leadership Club, helped start the Climate Change Awareness Club, and volunteered with different organizations whenever I could. I was on the varsity cheerleading team and was captain of my lacrosse team. So far here on campus, I am a member of the Tribe Cheer team and I have joined a sorority. I am very excited about both. I love meeting new people and learning about different cultures around the world. Although I haven’t had a ton of experience yet, I really want to travel and see the world. Whether I’m being introduced to a community as a whole or getting to know a new person one on one, I find it fascinating how unique we all are.
