# Cost of Aging
One topic of human development that I find interesting that we haven't had the chance to cover in class is population age. In the last century, the global population has increased dramatically. This major growth can be attributed to a few major changes, but the largest driving force behind it is the increasing number of people who survive into reproductive age. The global median age is getting older, which means the age structures of countries are changing. I am interested in learning more about the different effects that age distribution in a population can have. Specifically, the impact age structure has on the economic sector. In this article Ronald Lee and Andrew Mason address the “cost of aging” in terms of worker output and per capita income. It is written in a very understandable way and isn’t too long. I would love to discuss this in class and hear my classmate’s as well as your opinions on the topic.
