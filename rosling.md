# Rosling Response

### 1. What did Hans Rosling say about his survey of the new students at the Karolinka Institute and how they compared with the results from the Chimpanzees (as well as the faculty who decide the Nobel)? What is the significance of the results from his informal survey on preconceived ideas?

Rosling’s initial goal for his survey was to determine how much his students already knew about global health by giving them 5 pairs of countries and asking which country in each pair has a higher child mortality rate. However, when he was compiling the results, he realized the significance of his test. With his class scoring at an average 1.8 questions right, Rosling had shown that Sweden’s topmost students knew statistically less about the world than chimpanzees, who scored an average of 2.5. He administered the test to those of his colleagues at the Karolinka Institute that award the Nobel prize and found that with an average score of 2.4 they scored on par, if not slightly lower, than the chimps. This shows how skewed most people perceive the world around them. The reality of a third world country today is very different today than what it was in the 60s, but perception of these countries by people in developed countries has not evolved along side them. People in developed countries view vastly underestimate the progress and development that has been made in third world countries. 

### 2. What type of change took place in Asia preceded economic growth? Why was this type of change significant?

### 3. In accordance with Hans Rosling's TED talk, what is the relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita?

### 4. In terms of income distribution, how has the world changed from 1962 until 2003?

### 5. What is the significance of how Hans Rosling uses data to describe global human development in terms of high spatial and temporal resolutions? How does this relate to his previous observation regarding preconceived ideas?

### 6. In your opinion, why was Hans Rosling's work with the Gapminder project significant in contributing towards advancing the intersection of data science and global human development?
